**PROJECT ANALISIS**

**User profile**

The final user will be a company's HR department employee, who will review my CV for compare it with others to decide whether to hire me for the job. Therefore, my CV must have certain characteristics to attract his attention and to facilitate the drawing of conclusions. For example:

· Brief, persuasive explanations

· Colorful style

· Clear classification of information

**Information architecture**

For the distribution of elements in Figma, I have made the following general decisions:

· Name all the elements to make it easier to understand the structure.

· Make an organized distribution of groups and frames in order to drag several elements at once and get a greater control over the separations between them and the margins of the document.

For the distribution of the information I want to show, I have organized the document content in three main frames:

· Header: here I show the main information about me, my personal data. I have divided it into two sections, where the first contains my name, photo and a description of my current educational status and the second contains my contact information. I have decided to combine these two sections in the header because they must always be together at the top of the page and cover its entire width, adjusting to its given measurements.

· Left content column: of all the sections into which I have separated the content, here I begin by showing in the form of a column located on the left of the page those that I consider most important, the two referring to my educational training. I have separated the items that talk about my main educational background (education) from those that talk about extracurricular activities (additional training).

· Right content column: here I have placed the rest of the sections that I have considered appropriate in the form of a column on the right. The sections and points are displayed in the same way as in the left column, but in this case I show my level of speaking in different languages ​​(languages), my notable skills (skills) and other achievements and awards that I have obtained (other achievements).

In each content section, I have separated different points in a list with the aim of making the information more clear.

**PROJECT ANALISIS**

**User profile**

The final user will be a company's HR department employee, who will review my CV for compare it with others to decide whether to hire me for the job. Therefore, my CV must have certain characteristics to attract his attention and to facilitate the drawing of conclusions. For example:

· Brief, persuasive explanations

· Colorful style

· Clear classification of information

**Information architecture**

For the distribution of elements in Figma, I have made the following general decisions:

· Name all the elements to make it easier to understand the structure.

· Make an organized distribution of groups and frames in order to drag several elements at once and get a greater control over the separations between them and the margins of the document.

For the distribution of the information I want to show, I have organized the document content in three main frames:

· Header: here I show the main information about me, my personal data. I have divided it into two sections, where the first contains my name, photo and a description of my current educational status and the second contains my contact information. I have decided to combine these two sections in the header because they must always be together at the top of the page and cover its entire width, adjusting to its given measurements.

· Left content column: of all the sections into which I have separated the content, here I begin by showing in the form of a column located on the left of the page those that I consider most important, the two referring to my educational training. I have separated the items that talk about my main educational background (education) from those that talk about extracurricular activities (additional training).

· Right content column: here I have placed the rest of the sections that I have considered appropriate in the form of a column on the right. The sections and points are displayed in the same way as in the left column, but in this case I show my level of speaking in different languages ​​(languages), my notable skills (skills) and other achievements and awards that I have obtained (other achievements).

In each content section, I have separated different points in a list with the aim of making the information more clear.

**Visual design**

For the visual design of the document, I have made the following general decisions:

· Not to leave any part of the page without a background color, to ensure that the CV stands out against the standard expectations of a white background.

· Make a significant use of icons, to prevent the text from monopolizing everything.

· Maintain consistency between the separations, margins, sizes and fonts of the letter.

· All the sections have a large title above so that the distribution of the content can be clearly distinguished at a glance.

For the visual design of each part:

· Header: my name and photograph are shown in a very large size to highlight what could be considered the title of the entire document. To separate the contacts section from the rest of the header, I have put a longer box with a different background color and a rounded edge.

· Left content column: to make the lists of these sections distinctive, I have put a bullet in front of each element. Since the section titles have the same font as the content, I have made them stand out by using capital letters and a darker background.

· Right content column: here I have made the same design decisions as in the left column, only highlighting the rectangles with rounded edges that I have used to show my speaking level in each language, with the aim of reducing the use of text, as with the use of icons.
